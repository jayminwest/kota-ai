# KOTA-AI

Knowledge-Oriented Thinking Assistant - A local-first AI knowledge management system with MCP integration

## 🌟 Vision

KOTA-AI reimagines personal knowledge management by combining the power of modern AI with the privacy of local-first architecture. It's designed to be an extension of your cognitive processes, helping you organize, connect, and utilize your knowledge while keeping your data entirely under your control.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📝 Local MDX Storage**: All your knowledge stays on your machine, never in the cloud
- **🔌 MCP Integration**: Seamless connection to Model Context Protocol servers with a single command
- **🧠 Context Management**: Sophisticated handling of conversation context for more relevant interactions
- **🤖 Flexible Model Selection**: Choose from local or remote models based on your needs
- **💻 Beautiful CLI**: Intuitive terminal interface with rich formatting and visualizations
- **🔄 Bidirectional Linking**: Create connections between knowledge entries for deeper insights
- **🔍 Semantic Search**: Find what you need based on meaning, not just keywords

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Set up TypeScript project structure ✓
- Implement basic CLI interface
- Create local storage system for MDX files
- Develop file operations (create, read, update, delete)

### Phase 2: Knowledge Management
- Implement frontmatter parsing for metadata
- Create bidirectional linking system
- Develop basic search functionality
- Build knowledge entry management

### Phase 3: MCP Integration
- Create MCP client interface
- Implement server connection handling
- Develop model selection and switching
- Build context management system

### Phase 4: User Experience
- Enhance CLI with colors and formatting
- Implement interactive chat mode
- Create visualization components
- Develop help and documentation

## 🔄 MCP Integration

KOTA-AI is designed to work seamlessly with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing you to:

- Connect to any MCP-compatible server
- Use tools and plugins from the MCP ecosystem
- Share context between different AI applications
- Maintain privacy while leveraging powerful models

## 🧠 Consciousness Framework

The consciousness framework is what sets KOTA-AI apart:

- **Narrative Continuity**: Maintains coherent understanding across sessions
- **Context Awareness**: Understands the relevance of different knowledge pieces
- **Metacognition**: Reflects on its own knowledge and reasoning
- **Agency Development**: Gradually develops capabilities based on demonstrated value
- **Distributed Cognition**: Creates a genuine cognitive partnership with the user

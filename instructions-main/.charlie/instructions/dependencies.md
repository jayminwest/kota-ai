# Dependencies

- Minimize external dependencies. Before adding a new dependency, evaluate if the functionality can be achieved reasonably with existing Node.js/Web APIs or current project dependencies.
- If adding a dependency, prefer well-maintained, reputable packages with good documentation and community support. Check for security vulnerabilities.
- Add dependencies using `npm install <package>` (for runtime) or `npm install --save-dev <package>` (for development/build time).
- Keep dependencies up-to-date, but update cautiously, checking for breaking changes.

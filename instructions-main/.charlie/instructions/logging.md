# Logging

- Use standard `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error` for logging for now.
- Add meaningful prefixes or context to log messages where appropriate (e.g., `[MCP Client] Connection established`).
- Avoid logging sensitive information (API keys, user data).
- A dedicated logging library (like Pino or Winston) might be introduced later if needed for structured logging, log levels, or different output destinations.

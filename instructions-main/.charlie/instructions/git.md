## Git & GitHub

- Branch names should start with `bot-123-the-issue-name` where `bot-123` is the Linear issue identifier associated with the branch and `the-issue-name` is the name of the issue (or a shortened version)
- Commit messages should be short, concise, and descriptive
- Pull requests should have a short descriptive title and a description that explains the changes made
- PR titles and descriptions must accurately reflect the changes made and should be kept up to date if the PR changes significantly
- Linear identifiers (eg: BOT-123) should not be included in PR titles (they should be in the branch name)
- Proper capitalization and punctuation should always be used in commit messages and pull request titles and descriptions

## Git & GitHub

- Branch names should follow the pattern `type/issue-number-short-description`, e.g., `feat/123-add-search-command`, `fix/456-config-parsing`. Use types like `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`.
- The `dev/` branch represents the most up-to-date version of the project's development and should be used as the base branch for all pull requests.
- Commit messages should be short, concise, and descriptive, ideally following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (e.g., `feat: Add list command with basic filtering`).
- Pull requests should have a short descriptive title and a description that explains the changes made, linking to the relevant issue(s).
- PR titles and descriptions must accurately reflect the changes made and should be kept up to date if the PR changes significantly
- Linear identifiers (eg: BOT-123) should not be included in PR titles (they should be in the branch name)
- Proper capitalization and punctuation should always be used in commit messages and pull request titles and descriptions

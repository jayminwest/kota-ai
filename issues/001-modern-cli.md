## Description

The current CLI (`src/cli.ts`) is functional but very basic. We should enhance it to provide a more modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing experience.

**Inspiration:**

Consider interfaces like the one shown in the attached screenshot (`temp.png`). Key elements to potentially incorporate include:

-   **Clear Structure:** Use borders, spacing, or distinct sections to organize output (e.g., status information, tips, prompts).
-   **Color & Formatting:** Utilize terminal colors and text formatting (bold, italics) to improve readability and highlight important information.
-   **Better Guidance:** Provide clearer prompts and context-sensitive help/tips (e.g., available commands, modes).
-   **Interactive Elements:** Explore libraries that enable more interactive command-line experiences if appropriate for features like `kota chat`.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

-   Investigate suitable Node.js libraries for building modern CLIs (e.g., `chalk`, `commander`, `inquirer`, `ora`, `boxen`, `ink`).
-   Refactor `src/cli.ts` to use chosen libraries.
-   Improve the output formatting for existing commands (e.g., `init`, help messages).
-   Establish a consistent visual style for the CLI.

**Screenshot Reference:**

*(Assuming `temp.png` is available or described)*
The reference screenshot shows a CLI with:
- A bordered box for welcome messages/status.
- Clear headings like "Tips for getting started:".
- Numbered lists for instructions.
- A distinct input prompt area (`> Try "how do I log an error?"`).
- Footer hints for commands/modes.

This enhancement will significantly improve the user experience when interacting with KOTA-AI.

## Description

As part of Phase 3 (MCP Integration) outlined in the README, we need to implement the client-side logic for connecting to and interacting with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. This involves using the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to build a robust client within the `src/mcp/` directory.

We also need to establish the infrastructure for managing these connections, allowing users to easily add, list, and connect to different MCP servers via the KOTA CLI (e.g., using the planned `kota connect <server>` command).

**References:**

*   MCP TypeScript SDK Documentation (provided previously)
*   MCP Specification: [https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io)
*   KOTA-AI README: Phase 3 & Commands sections

## Acceptance Criteria

*   Add `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` as a project dependency.
*   Create initial MCP client implementation within `src/mcp/client.ts` (or similar).
*   Implement logic to establish connections to MCP servers using the SDK's `Client` and transport classes (initially focusing on `StdioClientTransport` and potentially `HttpClientTransport` for SSE).
*   Develop a mechanism to store and manage connection details for multiple MCP servers (e.g., in the `.kota-ai` configuration).
*   Integrate the connection logic with the CLI, enabling the `kota connect <server>` command (or a similar mechanism) to initiate a connection.
*   Handle basic client lifecycle events (connect, disconnect, errors).
*   Define basic interfaces/types within `src/types/` related to MCP server configurations.

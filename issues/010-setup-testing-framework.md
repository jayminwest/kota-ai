# Issue 010: Setup Testing Framework

## Description

We need to establish a comprehensive testing framework for the KOTA-AI project. The current codebase lacks proper testing, which makes it difficult to ensure reliability and prevent regressions as we continue development.

## Requirements

1. **Testing Framework Selection**
   - Use Vitest as the primary testing framework (as indicated in the project instructions)
   - Configure it to work well with TypeScript
   - Set up proper test reporting and coverage analysis

2. **Test Organization**
   - Create a clear structure for tests that mirrors the source code organization
   - Implement unit tests for individual components
   - Implement integration tests for interactions between components
   - Add end-to-end tests for critical user workflows

3. **Testing Philosophy**
   - **IMPORTANT**: Tests should use real implementations whenever possible
   - Mocks should be avoided except in very specific circumstances:
     - External API calls that would incur costs
     - Services that are difficult to instantiate in a test environment
     - Time-dependent operations that would make tests slow or flaky
   - Even in these cases, prefer real implementations running in test mode over mocks

4. **Test Data**
   - Create fixtures and test data that can be reused across tests
   - Ensure test data is representative of real-world scenarios

5. **CI Integration**
   - Configure tests to run automatically in CI/CD pipelines
   - Fail builds when tests fail or when coverage drops below an acceptable threshold

## Implementation Plan

1. Set up the basic Vitest configuration
2. Create initial test structure and helpers
3. Implement tests for core utilities and services first
4. Gradually expand test coverage to all components
5. Add integration and end-to-end tests for critical paths
6. Configure CI/CD integration

## Acceptance Criteria

- All new code must include tests
- Test coverage should be at least 80% for critical components
- Tests must run quickly and reliably
- CI pipeline must include test execution
- Documentation on how to run and write tests must be added to the project

## Additional Notes

Testing is not just about catching bugs but also about documenting expected behavior and providing confidence when making changes. By prioritizing real implementations over mocks, we ensure our tests verify actual behavior rather than our assumptions about how components should interact.
